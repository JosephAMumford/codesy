<dl>
   <dt>Why is codesy open source?</dt>
   <dd><p>We believe open source simply creates better software for everyone - anyone - around the world. As open source developers ourselves, we don't appreciate proprietary companies that profit off the open source community without giving us access to their code. So, codesy has been completely open-source from the beginning, and we invite you to <a href="https://github.com/codesy" target="_new">help us make it</a> the best funding platform for the open source community.</p>

<dl>
   <dt>Why can't I see the bid amounts?</dt>
   <dd><p>codesy is designed to participate in the open source ecosystem, not to change or over-commercialize it. We hide the financial amounts of bugs to protect the established social market of the community. Publicizing bid amounts associates an artificial and detrimental monetary value to what is otherwise a social activity.</p>
