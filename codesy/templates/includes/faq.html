   <dt>What is a bid?</dt>
   <dd>
     <p>
     When you land on a bug, you can quickly and easily "bid" a couple of amounts:
     <ol>
       <li>How much do you <strong>offer</strong> for someone to fix it</li>
       <li>How much do you <strong>ask</strong> to fix it yourself</li>
     </ol>
     So, you can contribute to get the bug fixed, you can say how much you would need to fix it yourself, or both.

   <dt>What is a claim?</dt>
   <dd>When a developer has fixed a bug, they submit a claim with a URL as evidence of their fix, so that the offering bidders on the bug can approve (or reject) their claim.</dd>

   <dt>How are claims approved?</dt>
   <dd><p>When a developer submits their claim, the offering bidders must <em>unanimously approve</em> the claim, so the offering bidders are completely satisfied.</p>
   <p><em>Note: We are eager to learn more models for approving claims. If you have an idea, please <a href="https://github.com/codesy/codesy/issues/new" target="_blank">file an issue on GitHub</a></em></p>
