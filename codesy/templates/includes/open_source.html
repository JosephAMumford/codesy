      <h2>Open Source</h2>
      <p>We believe open source simply creates better software for everyone - anyone - around the world. As open source developers ourselves, we don't appreciate proprietary companies that profit off the open source community without giving us access to their code. So, codesy has been completely open-source from the beginning, and we invite you to <a href="https://github.com/codesy" target="_new">help us make it</a> the best funding platform for the open source community.</p>
       <p>For more on this, see <a href="https://www.redhat.com/about/whoisredhat/opensource.html" target="_new">Red Hat's Why open source?</a> page.</p>
