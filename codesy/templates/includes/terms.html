Definitions

Issue:  Open Source software problem or bug posted on a public website.
Offer: Amount of money a user contributes toward fixing an issue
Ask: Amount of money a user requests to fix and issue
Bid: The combination of a Offer and Ask made by a user
Claim: Assertion by a user that an issue has been fixed.
Payout: Money sent to user with an approved claim.


How the codesy.io Application Process Works

codesy.io is an Application that matches users asking for money with users offering money for fixing open source software issues.
The process follows these steps:
1.	When viewing an issue on an open source project, users tell codesy how much they would contribute (‘offer’) to someone fixing the issue and how much they would want to receive (‘ask’) to fix the issue themselves.
2.	Users making offers acknowledge that they shall be immediately charged for payment of their offer, and this payment does not entitle the Offeror to receive any services or goods.
3.	Codesy notifies users when the sum of amounts offered matches their asking amount.
4.	Users fix the bug and claim a payout by providing evidence of the fix.
5.	Codesy notifies all offerors of the claim and allows them to vote on it
6.	The Offerors shall review the work and vote whether or not that the Issue was claimed by the Fixer. The Issue is finalized, assuming it was approved, unless there is a vote that disapproves the work (although this is subject to change).
7.	Once the Issue is approved, the claimaint can request a payout for the amount asked.
8.	Codesy will send the payment.

codesy.io is not obligated to provide refunds under any circumstance. Askers are responsible for producing the work on an Issue they offer. codesy.io does not hold funds on behalf of Offeror(s), and does not warrant or guarantee that Askers(s) will provide the Services they promise.

Users use the codesy.io Application at their own risk.

codesy.io reserves the right to eject, suspend, or remove a(n) Ask/Offer/Bid/Issue at any time, and for any reason.

Offerors are not permitted to create issues for illegal activities, to cause harm to people or property, or to scam others. If the Issue and bid is claiming to do the impossible or it's deceiving, do not post it. Users must comply with all applicable laws and regulations. Bidders shall not make any false or misleading statements in connection with their Issues, bids, Services or Claims.
