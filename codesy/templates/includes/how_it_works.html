<h2>How Does It Work</h2>
     <ol>
       <li>Add the codesy addon to your browser.
       <li>When you visit a bug, you'll see a codesy form with two questions:
       <ul>
         <li>How much can you offer for someone else to fix it?</li>
         <li>How much would you ask for to fix it yourself?</li>
       </ul>
       <li>Bid your amounts.</li>
       <li>codesy collects all bids, and monitors all bugs.</li>
       <li>codesy lets developers know when all the offers add up to their asking price.</li>
       <li>The developer fixes the bug and claims the payout.</li>
       <li>Codesy notifies all the bidders and they vote to accept the fix.</li>
       <li>When the voters approve the fix, the developer get the payout.</li>
     </ol>
